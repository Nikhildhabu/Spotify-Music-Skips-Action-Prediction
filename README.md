# Spotify-Music-Skips-Action-Prediction (deployment link https://spotify-track-skip-predicition.herokuapp.com/)
The goal of the challenge is to predict the likelihood of a user skipping any given song during a listening session.

[New_model_spotify.py](https://github.com/Nikhildhabu/Spotify-Music-Skips-Action-Prediction/blob/main/New_model_spotify.py) for model selection and to save to use/load for further test dataset. rfc and lgbm models used.

[wed_development.py](https://github.com/Nikhildhabu/Spotify-Music-Skips-Action-Prediction/blob/main/web_development.py) for Model deployment on webpage using streamlit.

[rfc_model_TestAcc.zip](https://github.com/Nikhildhabu/Spotify-Music-Skips-Action-Prediction/blob/main/rfc_model_TestAcc.zip) unzip it to use rfc model pickle file for web app[wed_development.py](https://github.com/Nikhildhabu/Spotify-Music-Skips-Action-Prediction/blob/main/web_development.py).
